This website owes its inception to a lull in funding for a project at work (context switching always requires a certain amount of procrastination on my part), the recent presidential election (which has thrown me off my stride), and a request from one of my daughters for a description of my apple crumble (knowing that I don't follow recipes, she asked if I would just describe how to make it.)
