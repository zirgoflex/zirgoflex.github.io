## Ingredients

- apples
- 4 oz butter or other shortening (olive or coconut oil for vegan)
- 2 cups rolled oats
- 1 cup brown sugar
- cinnamon *(facultatif)*

Preheat oven to 375&deg;F (190&deg;C)

## Apples

Just peeled sliced apples underneath - Mcintosh will be a bit soft but nice and tangy -  Cortlands are classic. They will may cook down somewhat - fill the casserole to an inch or two below the top. (Or whatever, depending on the preferred crumble-to-apple ratio.)

## Crumble Topping

Topping is brown sugar, rolled oats, and shortening

The classic recipe is something like a stick of butter, 2 cups oats and a cup of brown sugar. You can put a bit of cinnamon in the topping but it is hardly necessary . 

If the rolled oats are on the chewy side of the quick-chewy spectrum, use 1/3 flour or the crumble won't stick together very much.

I go a little lighter on the shortening - you can use olive oil, and or coconut oil instead of butter. If you use butter, you will want it at room temperature for ease in mixing.

Use dark brown sugar if you have choice between dark and light

## Bake

Bake uncovered at 350&deg;F to 375 for 30 to 45 minutes until the top is browning nicely and getting crusty.
