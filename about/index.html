	<h1>Zirgoflex</h1>
	<p>
	Zirgoflex is a french word meaning "dinglehopper"
	</p>
	<p>
	This website owes its inception to 
	a lull in funding for a project at work (context switching always requires a certain amount of procrastination on my part),
	the recent presidential election (which has thrown me off my stride), 
	and a request from one of my daughters for a description of my apple crumble (knowing that I don't follow recipes, she asked if I would just describe how to make it.)
