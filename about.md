Zirgoflex is a french word meaning "dinglehopper"

This website owes its inception to a lull in funding for a project at work (context switching always requires a certain amount of procrastination on my part), the recent presidential election (which has thrown me off my stride), and a request from one of my daughters for a description of my apple crumble (knowing that I don't follow recipes, she asked if I would just describe how to make it.)

This is my personal website. The views, opinions, delusions, recipes, and other stuff expressed or presented here, while perhaps not my own, are not certainly necessarily those of my employer, my family, my friends, or anybody else, for that matter.

I make no representations as to accuracy, completeness, currentness, suitability, validity, plausibility, or internal consistency of any information on this site and will not be liable for any errors or omissions, or any losses, injuries, or damages arising from its display, use, misuse, re-use, or disuse.
